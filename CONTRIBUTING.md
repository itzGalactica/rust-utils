# Contributions to rust_utils
Rust_utils exists purely as a dependancy for my other Rust projects.
Please note that *contributions for new functionality are currently not
being accepted.* However, if you find a bug in the already-existing
functionality, by all means open an issue.

The usual rules about issues apply:
- Ensure your issue isn't a duplicate before you submit it
- Try to add as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the bug
- Include as much relevant info as possible (e.g. version, error messages, etc.)

If you think you can fix the issue, open an PR and link your issue to it.
Usual code contributions apply:
- Keep your code style consistent with the project and Rust style guidelines
- Try to write idiomatic Rust code and avoid any bad programming practices and hacky implementations
- Comment code that might not be obvious, and keep comments clear but concise
- Don't add or change any functionality

## The legal bit
I find this so annoying about open-source software.

**By submitting a pull request or other contribution, you grant the project maintainer a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and 
relicense your contributions as part of the project. You retain copyright over your work, but 
you agree it can be included under the project’s MIT license, and relicensed if necessary.**

To be clear, you still own your contributions. However, you are granting permission for your code 
to be used as a part of this project under its existing license, and any future license that 
this project may switch to in the future if absolutely necessary.
